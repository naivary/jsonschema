# JSON Schema

JSON Schema is a Go package for generating JSON Schema based upon defined marker
comments. There are already tools which are generating JSON Schema based upon
struct tags. This approach is kinda clumsy because it will amount to a lot of
tags to be set and at the same time the generate go-doc will not include those.
Marker comments on the otherside a normal Go comments which will be generated by
go doc. The concept is (as I know) originated by Kubernetes and Kubebuilder. If
you which to read more about it see [here](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/pkg/markers).

## Syntax
The syntax used to set the different markers is the following:
`jsonschema:category:option=values`.
